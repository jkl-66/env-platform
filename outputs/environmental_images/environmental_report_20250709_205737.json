  "professional_prompt": "A professional educational illustration depicting a heavily industrialized area suffering from severe environmental degradation. The scene focuses on thick, dark smoke rising from multiple factory chimneys, creating a dense, polluted atmosphere that obscures the sky. The air appears hazy and murky, with a dull, grayish tone that conveys the severity of the high carbon emissions (1500 billion tons) and the unhealthy AQI of 180. In the foreground, a river flows sluggishly, its surface covered in oil slicks and debris, reflecting the heavily polluted water pollution index of 85 WPI. Several birds, including gulls and ducks, are shown perched on rocks along the riverbank, their feathers coated in grime, highlighting the impact on local wildlife. The background features distant hills and trees, partially hidden by the smog, indicating the widespread reach of pollution. The color scheme is dominated by muted grays, deep blues, and browns, with subtle highlights of green in the distant vegetation to suggest hope and the potential for recovery. The lighting is dim and diffused, reinforcing the somber yet instructional tone of the image.",
