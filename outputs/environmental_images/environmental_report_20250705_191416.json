  "professional_prompt": "**Prompt:**  \nA realistic, educational image of a heavily industrialized area at sunrise. Thick smog hangs in the air, with a visible haze reducing visibility. The sky is gray and dull, reflecting the high AQI of 160. A river nearby shows signs of pollution, with floating debris and murky water, indicating a WPI of 75. Workers in protective masks walk along a polluted street, while children play nearby, unaware of the health risks. Factories emit dark smoke into the sky, and a carbon dioxide meter reads 1200 tons CO2 equivalent. The scene is captured in a professional documentary style, using muted tones with occasional bright highlights to emphasize hope. A small tree planted in a concrete lot symbolizes resilience and the potential for change.",
