  "professional_prompt": "**Prompt:**  \nA serene suburban park at sunrise, with clear blue skies and clean water reflecting the green trees. A group of students walks along a path, observing a small sign that reads \"Plastic Waste: 6 Tons/Year\" and \"Forest Loss: 6 Hectares/Year.\" In the background, a few plastic bottles lie on the ground, and a single tree shows signs of damage. The scene is captured in a realistic, documentary-style photography with soft morning light and vibrant colors. The image highlights the subtle but growing environmental challenges, while emphasizing the importance of individual and collective action for a sustainable future.",
